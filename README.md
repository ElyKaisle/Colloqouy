The internet today is replete with notions and sentiments that are in
opposition to ideals that promote or highlight intellectualism, liber-
ality and fair and rational interaction.  These notions and sentiments
come in the form of articles, posts or simple comments and the inter-
net, being free in its nature, allows the prominence of these harmful
ideas through the propagation of users who are often irrational and
vocal with their underdeveloped thoughts.  In the case of the com-
ments section on Facebook, these illogical users disrupt the harmony
of  intelligent  discussion  because  of  their  visibly  tactless  comments.
While there are forums on the Web that allows for undisturbed dis-
cussions,  they  are  often  obscure  and  used  only  by  certain  types  of
internet  users.   To  the  ordinary  or  casual  users,  the  interfaces  of
these  platforms  can  be  confusing  or  somewhat  intimidating  to  use.
A platform is needed that can be as accessible and easy to navigate
and use like Facebook and Twitter while reducing or eliminating the
flaws common in these popular networks which is the rampancy of
irrelevant and often distasteful expressions.
